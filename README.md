## Rules
> [!NOTE]  
> This section is only a snippet of the [[Rules]] page. Please check out the page itself for more information.

TaleStation's Rules are split up into two sections: Game Server and Discord Server.

<details>
<summary> Discord Rules </summary>

### 0. Rules are at the admins discretion.

Moderators and Admins alike are expected to uphold the rules of the Discord. Server staff may step in if Discord staff aren’t around.
If you come close to breaking the rules, you will be treated as breaking the rules. Don’t play the game of “how far can I push this”.
Admins have final say.

### 0.5 You're required to be 18 years or older.

We will never host NSFW channels in our Discord, but we do ask our participants to be mature and of age.
We will **NEVER** actively hound players out for their age. If someone comes forward and says they're underaged, they will be removed until they can prove they're 18, or wait the amount of year(s) needed for the individual to become 18.

### 1. Treat others the way you want to be treated.

Be respectful to fellow players, staff, and development staff. It’s understandable you’ll get into scuffles with people on disagreements. Agree to disagree or take it to DMs. If you’re unable to keep the peace and become disruptive, Discord staff will step in.

If you ignore a Discord staff's request to stop, you will be handled accordingly.

### 2. No meta communication of any on-going rounds from our server, or other servers.

Meta communication, or metacomming is the act of sharing information from a current round. This information can be used to gain an unfair advantage against other players. We have a **ZERO** tolerance for this. 
Metacomming can include, but is not limited to, Voice Chatting with someone, sharing images of an on going round (like who's a traitor), or talking about an on going round.

### 3. No politics or anything similar

This isn’t the place for it. This is a Space Station 13 Discord, not /pol/

### 4. No erotic, gore or general shock/trigger content.

Anything that is considered borderline will be counted as toeing the line with this rule.
This **DOES NOT** mean post porn/gore and spoiler it.

### 5. We have 0 tolerance on bigotry.

This includes, but is not limited to, any form of homophobia, transphobia, racism. These depictions may be through art, memes, videos, ect. Please tell the player approvers about dragons.
This also includes any form of IC racism that uses that word. None of that will be tolerated.

### 6. Your Discord account must be older than 60 days.

This is public information.

### 7. Do not use this Discord to advertise other SS13 servers.

This isn't the place to advertise other SS13 servers. If your Discord status, about me, pronouns, has a link to another server, we will ask you to change it.
It's fine to discuss other servers, but please keep in mind this isn't the space to recruit and invite new players. Do it in DMs or elsewhere.

### X. We're here to have fun.

Kick bakc and have fun. We're all here to share our stories!

### XX. These rules are subject to change.

This may come with or without prior warning.

<details>
<summary> Game Server Rules </summary>

### 0. Rules are at the admins discretion.

If admin intervention is required, **it’ll be invoked if a(n) admin(s) needs to**.

### 0.5 This is not an erotic server.

TaleStation will never endorse or host erotic content. Any and all ERP will result in a ban.
Being romantic, holding IC weddings/marriages is completely fine, so long they don't toe into ERP. 

### 1. This is a Roleplay server.

Players and Admins are expected to uphold the Roleplay Standard. We’re here to Roleplay and have fun. Remember, this isn’t a game about winning: it’s about Roleplaying!

### 2. Follow policy and SOP where needed.

Policy and SOPs (Standard Operating Procedure(s)) will outline more in-depth what's acceptable and what's not. If you're ever unsure, contact an admin. 

### X. These rules are subject to change.

These rules are subject to change in time, and with following policy to help strengthen some areas.

## Purpose Statement

TaleStation is a non-erotic, adult roleplay server.
We want to create a server where everyone and anyone can come and make a story for their characters. 
Classically, we'd be considered a "HRP" server, but we just want to be known as a true "RP" server. Interactions is key!

The environment here at TaleStation should be friendly to approach OOCly. If you have any issues, never be afraid to ahelp or ask staff. We'll try our best to answer questions you may have. Secondly, we want our players to be **as inclusive** as possible. Dramas, tragedies, and comedies abound. Try to include new people to your groups! Who knows, you may just make a new friend.

TaleStation aims to create an atmosphere rich with drama, tragedies, comedies, and more. Each story created by every player is unique in its own right; you don't need to be a writer either! Medbay was bombed! The CMO is missing- and there's a chef in the middle of chemistry.. what could this mean?! Each story doesn't need to be thoroughly planned out - it can be on a whim, it's perfectly OKAY! Stories can be a shift long or span across multiple shifts, the choice is yours!

Together, as players and staff, we aim to make TaleStation an enjoyable experience for those who aren't so RP heavy and those who enjoy RP.

-The TaleStation Administration and Development Staff
